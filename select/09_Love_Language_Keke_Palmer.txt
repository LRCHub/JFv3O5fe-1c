Can you read my mind?
Kiss me through my eyes
That's when I come alive
From my head to my thighs
Who are you after dark?
Let's meet the sun when it rises

I want you to learn me
You better put in that work, gotta earn me
Show me that you're worthy
Don't wanna give in too soon, it's too early
Ah, touch on me like nobody
I want you on my body
Before we leave the party

Talk to me in my love language
Talk to me in my love language
Ooh, get a piece of me, feel thе chemistry, it's the enеrgy
Talk to me in my love language

You've got what it takes
To make me switch up my pace
You know we got fire and desire
Goin' for days, don't get tired, tired
Say you ain't feenin', you a liar, liar
Took you off the game, made you retire

I want you to learn me
You better put in that work, gotta earn me
Show me that you're worthy
Don't wanna give in too soon, it's too early
Ah, touch on me like nobody
I want you on my body
Before we leave the party

Talk to me in my love language
Talk to me in my love language
Ooh, get a piece of me, feel the chemistry, it's the energy
Talk to me in my love language

Ooh, ooh, ooh, break my rules
Convince me to move how you move
Ooh, ooh, ooh, break my rules
Convince me to move how you move
Don't wanna be alone when I'm feeling faded, R-rated
Better take me home 'fore the moment's wasted

I want you to learn me
You better put in that work, gotta earn me
Show me that you're worthy
Don't wanna give in too soon, it's too early
Ah, touch on me like nobody
I want you on my body
Before we leave this party

Talk to me in my love language (Ooh, love language, woah)
Talk to me in my love language (I wanna talk to you)
Baby, can you, tell me, can you keep up now?

Talk to me in my love language (Oh, yeah, yeah)
Talk to me in my love language (I wanna hear you)
Boy, can you speak my
