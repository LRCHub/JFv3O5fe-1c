I won't wait for no fate
Butterflies don't know my way
Cold to touch, I feel your face
Dark clouds, hurry Let's disappear.
Settle in with, All our secrets here
Tell me is this real or is it fake
Our love has no fare
It's a deathly-ill runaway
Cause we know it's not safe
The best moments all seem to fade
Keep sleeping, All will soon be clear
Tell me is this real or is it fake?
Yeah!
I feel useless on stare
I feel desperate and unaware
I feel sick, but I'm fine
I've got tears under my eyes
You need heat Sleep, I'll warm up your air
Tell me is this real or is it fake?
I feel useless on stare
I feel desperate and unaware
I still wait for your sight
I've been waiting all my life
Still sleeping, No one could compare
Tell me is this real or is it fake?
Tell me is this real or is it fake?
