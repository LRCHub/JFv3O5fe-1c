It's the way you speak into my life
Make everything alright
I don't know what it is
Want it for the rest of my life
You kiss and hold me
Your love's a testimony
That dreams really come true
And I'm so in love with you

It's you
The way you touch me
Compliment me
For me you make time
Oh, you're the greatest
Taking care of me
Spoil me with everything
I don't want for nothing, so

Charge it to my head (my head)
Don't charge it to my heart (not my heart)
Teach me how to speak your love language (love language)
I'll charge it to your head (your head)
Not charge it to your heart (your heart)
I'll teach you how to speak my love language, yeah (love language)

Even if they said they could
I don't think that they would understand your love language
But baby, that's just for me, oh (for me)
It's me and you 'til the end
Homie, lover, friend

It's you
The way you touch me
Compliment me
For me you make time
Oh, you're the greatest
Taking care of me
Spoil me with everything
I don't want for nothing, so

Charge it to my head (my head)
Don't charge it to my heart (my heart)
Teach me how to speak your love language (love language)
I'll charge it to your head (your head)
Not charge it to your heart (your heart)
I'll teach you how to speak my love language, yeah (love language)

Words of affirmation
I tell 'em to you daily
I gotta keep it sexy
I'll do whatever that you tell me
I'm always at your service
Baby, you know you deserve it
Gifting me with time
That's why I know you are mine

Charge it to my head (my head)
Don't charge it to my heart (my heart)
Teach me how to speak your love language (love language)
I'll charge it to your head (your head)
Not charge it to your heart (your heart)
I'll teach you how to speak my love language, yeah (love language)
